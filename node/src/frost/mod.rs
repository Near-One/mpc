//! This module serves as a wrapper for Frost protocol.
//!
//! Frost library exposes methods like `sign::round1()`, `sign::round2()`, `sign::aggregate()`, etc.
//! The output of those functions needs to be communicated to other participants in a specific order.
//! Such a process can be described as a state machine and its state transitions.
//!
//! To construct it, an `impl Protocol` from `cait_sith` library was used, together with related "plumbing"
//! code, that allows us to implement a protocol as an async function with yield points,
//! which simplifies code maintenance.
//!
//! To run Frost protocol, we have to assign each participant its identifier.
//! We do so by converting existing `ParticipantId` via `to_frost_identifier()`.
//! This is a one way process, since the conversion requires hashing/modulo reduce.
//! In order to do the inverse cast (frost, EdDSA identifier) -> (cait-sith, Participant),
//! one should have all (historical) `Participants`.
//!
//! There's no identifiable aborts, i.e. you might see an Err(_) with e.g. "incorrect number of shares supplied",
//! or "Participant X supplied incorrect data", but pragmatically you will not be able to do anything with this info.
