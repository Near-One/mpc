E2E cluster tests:

### simple cluster:
Purpose:
- This is the base test, used for benchmarking. It can serve as a modular piece that tests

Test:
    1. deploy cluster
    2. track when cluster ready
    3. initialize contract
    4. wait for contract to resume running
    5. send requests. Track successes / errors
    6. tear down the cluster

modifs:
- introduce network hardship
- really loadtest. Ensure a certain qps is  met for a certain duration.


### Test contract update:
Purpose:
- Test if a specific node release is compatible with a specific contract release.
- Test if the contract migration logic works
- Test if key derivation paths are preserved

Test:
    - Repeat 1-5.
    - add a bunch of state
    - Update contract
    - ensure update succeeded
    - repeat 5
    - tear down cluster
    - ensure success metrics are met
    - ensure derivation path is preserved


### Test node update:
Purpose:
- Test if updating nodes to a different docker image works.

Test:
    - Repeat 1-5
    - update nodes 1-1 while sending signature requests
    - Repeat 5.
    - tear down cluster
    - ensure success metrics are met
    - ensure derivation path is preserved

modifs:
- introduce network hardship


Things to track:
- throughput
- time to sync
- RAM & CPU??
- successful vs unsucessful signature requests
